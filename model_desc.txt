Model: 
    - SEIR (Susceptible - Exposed - Infectious - Recovered)

Time:
    - Uses discrete steps

Legend:
    MID - Microparasitic Infectious Diseases
    S - Susceptible
    E - Exposed
    I - Infectious
    R - Recovered
    γ - Recover probability
    D - Duration of infection
    β - Transmission rate
    σ - Latency period of infection
    

Population:
    - Represented by a Cellular Automata

Basic interaction for immunity development to MID in a given population:

We assume that this is a well-mixed population.

- If a cell is (S)
    1. Count how many neighbors are (I)
    2. Calculate the infection probability
    3. Based on the result of the probability, decide if S state will change to either (E) or (I)
- if a cell is (E)
    1. Calculate if (E) is within the latency period σ
    2. If σ is expired, (E) becomes (I) 
- If a cell is (I)
    1. Stay infected for D steps
    2. Based on probability γ decide if I will change its state to (R)
- If a cell is (R)
    1. Stay recovered (immune)

Additional simulations:
    1. Change cells from places to simulate steps (e.g. moving through a neighborhood)
    2. Vaccination can be done by assigning (R) randomly to cells from time to time that can also be defined randomly
